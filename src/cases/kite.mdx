      <h2>Role of UI & UX</h2>
      <p>
        It is important to understand the needs of the client and come up to
        their expectations accordingly. For Kite digital arts we had to think
        aesthetically and make the navigation easier for the users who’d come to
        browse the site. The main motive for the website was to establish the
        importance of art that is disappearing gradually.

        Since the website was meant to sell art, it was important to make it
        look appealing because the first impression on consumers is always the
        last. Here the typography and colours were an integral part of designing
        Kite. Overall we worked towards making the user experience design in the
        website minimal, appealing and valuable.

      <h2>Understanding its role</h2>
      <p>
        Medishift is an application for medical sta where the sta can check,
        request, post or raise a query for a change in their schedule. It's a
        platform for all the medical sta and their schedules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The design for the application consisted of ve major steps which started
        from researching to style guide & UI element. All these steps should be
        carefully researched by a UX design agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make our application amazing we worked towards providing an amazing
        user interface and user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the initial stage of creating the application, we paid special
        attention to creating a user persona, since our application was
        user-oriented.

      <h2>Achieving great outputs with UI & UX</h2>
      <p>
        Good user experience and user interface both contribute towards
        increasing engagement. User interface design companies usually make an
        application stylish and elegant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, for a designer, it is essential to understand the importance of
        UI & UX in any application, we understand the essence of this concept.
        We created a user persona and researched the basic problems of the
        users. We found that users have to visit hospitals especially to raise a
        query or they cannot check their future schedules to plan their whole
        day. Here we understood the problem and the answer to the same was our
        application which was easy to use and was valuable for the users.

        A good wireframe combined with subtle fonts and colour palette made an
        impactful UI & UX. The visual design for the application de ned the
        brand. Additionally, we carefully selected the fonts and colours which
        positively a ected the user's behaviour.

      <h2>Ticketmaster- A place for all your tickets!</h2>
      <p>
        Ticketmaster is a mobile application that helps you book your tickets
        with a single tap. It allows you to link your cards and makes things
        easy for you. Making it clutter-free and keeping this application easy
        to go was our main priority since this application is meant to help
        users without any complications.

        Here, we followed a four-step UI & UX design process that started from
        digital wireframes, Low delity prototypes, Mockups and ended with high
        delity prototypes. We achieved these results through Figma, Adobe XD,
        Adobe Photoshop and Adobe illustrator.

      <h2>Why is UI & UX important?</h2>
      <p>
        Since the majority of the people use applications regularly and these
        people are attracted to unique designs that are relevant and
        consumer-friendly. Such results can only be achieved with the help of
        great UI UX designers who are proactive with all the new software,
        designs or what their competitors are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering all the above points we created a wireframe that was
        meaningful and provided value. Our motive was to create an application
        that wins the con dence of its users and make them use the application
        in their daily lives and creating the best design was our top priority
        since it represents the trustworthiness of any application. A great UI &
        UX gives users a realistic feeling which makes it more attractive.

      <h3>Designing of Ticketmaster</h3>
      <p>
        Designing Ticketmaster was a process that we divided into four parts. It
        covered all the aspects of the application ranging from informative
        architecture to interactive design. Before the visuals, we created a
        wireframe that evaluated if the application is serving the purpose or
        not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from all this, visuals were kept minimal with subtle colours to
        enhance the brand personality. Seamless navigation and an attractive
        interface are all that we tried to work on.

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        Great designs generate great outputs that achieve the primary goal of
        any business but to create them one should be aware of everything and
        cover all the aspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days we nd all the applications of similar type but thereâ€™s always
        a slight di erence in their UI UX and that slight di erence is what
        makes an application success or a failure.

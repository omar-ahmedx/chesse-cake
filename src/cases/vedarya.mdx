      <p>
        We are a team of creative people and we understand how crucial the
        process of UI design is for any mobile application. From creating mood
        boards to researching user persona, everything requires a lot of
        attention to get outstanding results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vedarya is one of our projects and through it, we wanted to help
        children have a better understanding of mathematics to score better and
        learn faster.

        Vedarya is a mobile application to familiarise children with the concept
        of Vedic mathematics which helps in simplifying the calculations. It
        provides learning entertainingly and engagingly. Apart from this, it
        helps children to cope in this fast world where mathematics is the key

        Keeping in mind our audience, we followed the double diamond design
        process to make it user friendly and interactive for children. Online
        surveys and interviews were the start of our research where we made sure
        to know what our consumers desire when they use any particular
        application. We also observed that children are anxious about learning
        maths because of the complex calculations and monotonous methods of
        teaching

      <p>
        All of our design strategies are followed keeping in mind our potential
        users who are either children between 6-18 years or individuals who want
        to learn Vedic maths. After reviewing the needs, we made sure to make
        this application full of easy learning with a rewarding system which is
        principal motivation.

      <h3>Achieving it with UI & UX designer</h3>
      <p>
        The glory of any mobile application depends upon UI UX and a designer
        needs to understand various aspects of an application.
      </p>
      <p>
        For vedarya the style guide was made for the UI to help users grab
        attention to necessary information such as the header, reduce the
        cognitive lead and also keep the consistency throughout the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Buttons, typography and colours are used in a very subtle way which also
        gives a warm feeling to the users and highlights the brand value.
        Additionally, it was a step taken by the UI designers which made the
        users bond with the application.

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        The world is evolving at a very high pace and we need to make sure that
        children around us are coping with their surroundings without feeling
        anxious. Vedarya is one such platform that is a blend of fun and
        learning which makes you grow out of your fears. Being a UI UX design
        agency we understood and achieved it. Designing an application with a
        motive that includes all the wit and wisdom is indeed worth it.
